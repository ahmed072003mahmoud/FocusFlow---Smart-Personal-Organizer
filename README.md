# 🧬 FocusFlow: Ethical Design Manifesto

## 1. Anti-Features (What we refuse to build)
- **No Streaks**: We reject the "broken streak" guilt. Consistency is measured by quality, not consecutive days.
- **No Social Comparison**: Your productivity is private. No leaderboards or competitive ranking.
- **No "Overdue" Red**: Tasks are never "late"; they are simply "unmet expectations" that need rescheduling.
- **No Tutorial Overload**: Complexity is revealed only when the user's behavior signals readiness.

## 2. Ethical Notification Logic
- **Forbidden Hours**: No notifications between 10 PM and 7 AM unless explicitly requested for "Night Owl" mode.
- **Silence over Noise**: If the user is in "Zen Mode," all system interruptions are physically blocked.
- **Contextual Reminders**: Notifications adapt to energy levels. If the user is "Tired," the app suggests rest instead of a task.

## 3. Design Success Metrics (Non-Vanity)
- **Friction to Action Ratio**: How many seconds between opening the app and starting a Zen Session? (Target: < 5s).
- **Recovery Rate**: How quickly does a user return after a 2-day break without feeling overwhelmed?
- **Cognitive Load Balance**: Percentage of sessions spent in "Flow" vs. "Organizing."
