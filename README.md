# 🧬 FocusFlow: Smart Personal Organizer

FocusFlow is an ethically designed, AI-powered productivity system for students and high-performers who value deep work and psychological balance over vanity metrics.

## 🌟 Product Vision
We believe productivity isn't about doing more; it's about being aware of what matters. FocusFlow uses a "Monochrome Logic" UI to reduce visual fatigue and a "Cognitive Load" engine to prevent burnout.

## 🚀 User Journey
1. **Clear the Mind**: Use "Brain Dump" to offload mental clutter. AI parses these into structured tasks.
2. **Dynamic Priority**: The engine scores tasks based on priority, deadlines, and past behavior.
3. **Deep Work**: Enter "Zen Mode" with a Pomodoro timer and ambient sounds.
4. **DNA Mapping**: Visualize your behavioral patterns through monthly heatmaps and identity badges.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript (ESM modules)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Monochrome Design System)
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (Flash Lite for parsing, Pro for strategy)
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (Primary) + LocalStorage (Hydration)
- **Privacy**: Local-first processing via Web Workers
- **Gamification**: Custom Behavior & Experience Engines

## 🗺 Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Task logic, basic habits, local storage.
- **Phase 2 (AI Integration)**: Strategic analysis, voice-to-task parsing.
- **Phase 3 (Analytics)**: Behavioral heatmaps, focus session tracking, DNA stats.
- **Phase 4 (PWA & Offline)**: Installable app, full offline functionality with IndexedDB.
- **Phase 5 (Cloud Sync)**: Optional end-to-end encrypted backup.

## 🛡 Ethical Manifesto
- No streaks for the sake of anxiety.
- No "Overdue" red unless critical.
- Absolute data privacy: your brain dump stays on your device.
